# Job Hunt 2024 Wrapped
Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, but it's for all the jobs I applied to in 2024.

When I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with my Bachelor or Science in Mathematics in May 2023, I had already been accepted into their online Master's program for Data Science. Becoming a data scientist was my goal from the beginning, thus, the Master's program seemed like a natural course of action. However, I had not been paying attention to the job market. Many of my classmates who had exceptional grades, many extracurricular involvement, and projects struggles to find full-time employment, especially in the tech sector. 

I thought I was safe, hoping that the job market will sprout back upon graduation from my Master's program in December 2025. However, in such a competitive field, experience was everything. Additionally, most of my classmates are full-time employees already in the field, many often talking about their families/children and balancing classes with their job. Fear and imposter syndrome set in and I began to apply to jobs, both full-time and internships. If my classmates can balance a full-time job and school, why couldn't I?

The answer is that I could not because *no one would hire me*. I have one past internship experience and few projects. I am not the ideal candidate. I am a small fish in a big pond. 

I spent many hours of 2024, scrolling on LinkedIn, making accounts on Workday, and tracking the progress of all of my applications. However, 2025 has dawned upon us. The most I could get out of my time now is to make a project out of it and hope that potential recruiters and/or employers see it! Hello! I am in need of a job or experience! I have skills! Please do not hesitate to reach out! :D 

Regardless if you are a recruiter, employer, curious, or here for fun, thank you for taking the time to look at my 2024 Job Hunt Wrapped.
